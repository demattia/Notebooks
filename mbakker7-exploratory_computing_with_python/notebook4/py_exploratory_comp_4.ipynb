We already learned about two of types: variables passed to the function through the argument list, like `x` in the function above, and local variables, like `a` and `b` in the function above. The third type are variables defined outside the function but not passed to the function through the argument list. When a variable is used inside a Python function, Python first checks whether the function has been declared locally. If not, it checkes whether the variable is passed to the function through the argument list. And if that is not the case, Python checks whether the variable is defined outside the function, from the place the function was called. If that is not the case either, it will throw an error message. It is considered good coding practice to pass variables to a function when they are needed inside a function, rather than counting on Python to *find* the variable outside the function; it will likely lead to fewer coding errors as well.\n",
