      "The file `oil_price.dat` contains the monthly oil price since 1985. Your task is to load and plot the oil price vs. the date, and to determine the month and year the oil price first rose above 40 euros, above 60 euros, and above 80 euros (you need to write to the screen something like `The oil price exceeds 40 euros in` and then the month and year, etc.). Open the file in the Canopy editor to see what it looks like. As you can see, the first column contains the month in the format 'yyyy-mm' and the second column contains the monthly price, in Euros, of one barrel of raw oil (from the <a href=\"http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/browse.do?node=2120782\" target=\"_blank\"> european bank website</a>). To load the file with `loadtxt`, we need to convert the first column to a date. You can specify this with a keyword argument. The `loadtxt` help tells you that if column 0 is a date string then add the keyword: \n",
      "`converters = {0: datestr2num}`. Don't forget the braces `{}` symbols! To make a graph where the horizontal axis represents dates, use the `plot_date` function. To make the plot look nice, you may want to rotate the years along the tick marks using the `xticks(rotation=xx)` command, where `xx` is the angle you want to give to the ticks."
